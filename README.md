aliases
=======

debian/ubuntu aliases of my own


I put all those there with different purposes in mind:
- ease the exchange with my linux wonderful world co-explorators (Grüßen Nitneuk & Stefen)
- get eventual tips, feedbacks and improvements suggestions
- get my hand on git & github (see 'Help for Git & Github' hereafter)


How To
-------

- find the aliases that fit your need in the text files (sorted by thematic)
- open the file ~/.bash_aliases for edition and paste the alias (create one if none)
- save
- reload the aliases with the command . ~/.bashrc (reload aliases globally: ~/.bash_aliases is just for your session)


Manipulate Aliases
-------
see 'alias management.txt'
functionalities includes:
- edit aliases ('edal')
- reload aliases ('real')
- add an alias to aliases from command line ('addal')
- search in existing aliases ('catag')

Installation required
-------
- Some commands require to install packages (nethogs, xrandr...): time to fire your 'agi'!
